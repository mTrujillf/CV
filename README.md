## Project Structure  

### **1. Java: Multiplayer Game with Sockets and Multicast**  
This project demonstrates a multiplayer game where multiple users can participate. The game uses **sockets** and **multicast** for communication and includes functionality to save user information.  

- **Features:**  
  - Real-time interaction between multiple users.  
  - Persistent storage of user data.  
  - Networking with sockets and multicast.  

### **2. MATLAB: Solar System Trajectory Simulator**  
This folder contains a project that uses **interpolation techniques** to simulate the trajectories of planets in the solar system.  

- **Features:**  
  - Visualization of planetary motion in a simulated solar system.  
  - Accurate trajectory generation using interpolation algorithms.  

### **3. Python: Drone Navigation and Competition Codes**  
This folder focuses on drone navigation and includes:  
- **Dark Navigation Example:** A Python script demonstrating how a drone can navigate in darkness.  
- **IMAV 2024 Competition Codes:** Scripts used during the IMAV 2024 competition, showcasing tasks like waypoint navigation, landing, and obstacle avoidance.  
- **OptiTrack Integration Codes:** Python scripts for integrating drones with OptiTrack for precise tracking and control.  

- **Features:**  
  - Autonomous drone navigation examples.  
  - Competition-tested drone control scripts.  
  - Integration with OptiTrack for enhanced precision.
